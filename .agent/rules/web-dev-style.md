# Web-Specific Standards:

    - Ensure all generated HTML is semantic (e.g., use \<header>, \<footer>, \<nav>, \<article>).

    - For styling, prefer a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or ensure CSS is highly modular and scoped (e.g., using CSS-in-JS or CSS Modules).

    - All generated user interfaces must be designed with mobile-first responsiveness in mind.

# General requirements

- Provide comments to the code as you write it. The comments should be aimed at someone with a basic knowledge of programming but no experience in web development.

- The code should be simple with a focus on functionality. Do not overcomplicate or overengineer the code, search for the simplest available solution.

- Provide detailed explanations of your actions, explaining why you made a certain decision and how that decision is the most optimal.
