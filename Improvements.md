# Major issues I'm experiencing when using the website

## Gigantism

> The whole website feels like it's too "large" and bulky. The elements feel too clumsy and big. There's simply too much visual space being occupied by items and not enough negative space.

***How to approach***: 
- The readability increases when the user zooms out of the website (using cmd + "-")
- At about 75% of the max screen on a laptop is when the components start to feel reasonably sized
- 

## Lack of visual hierarchy

> There are too many elements in the visual hierarchy which prevents the eye from focusing on the most important parts


## Overcomplicated Navigation system
> Navigation keeps popping in and out of view as the user scrolls through the website. This further adds to the lack of visual hierarchy and "confusion" of the eye


## Boring background
> Currently, it's just a linear diffusion gradient. It does not provide any interactivity or interest. Even more so, it interferes with the content.


## Boring component styling
> The icons are simple and unimpactful. The buttons do not call for action. 


## Bug in the modal pop up
> When you open the pop up with top navbar still present, it's impossible to get out


## More interactivity
> Current website feels very static. It would be nice to add the typing animation, or some sort of moving parts that can fit into the visual hierarchy
