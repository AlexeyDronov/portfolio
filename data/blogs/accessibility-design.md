Accessibility ensures that your website is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. It's not just a legal requirement; it's a moral imperative.

## Best Practices

1. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>`.
2. **Color Contrast**: Ensure text is readable against the background.
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Make sure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.

Let's build a more inclusive web together.
