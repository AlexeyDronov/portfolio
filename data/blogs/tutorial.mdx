# Welcome to MDX

This is an **MDX** file. It allows you to write standard Markdown while also embedding React components directly!

## Standard Formatting

You can use all standard markdown features:

*   **Bold text** for emphasis
*   *Italic text* for subtlety
*   [Links](https://nextjs.org) to cool places

## Code Snippets

We use `JetBrains Mono` for our code snippets, making them super readable.

```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
```

## Lists

1.  First item
2.  Second item
3.  Profit!

## Blockquotes

> "The combination of Markdown and JSX is powerful."

## Why Custom Fonts?

We are using:
- **JetBrains Mono** for code and technical details.
- **Space Grotesk** for headings to give a futuristic feel.
- **IBM Plex Sans** for body text ensuring high readability.

Enjoy writing!
