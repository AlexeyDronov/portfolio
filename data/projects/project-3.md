## Overview
Voting integrity is a major issue in modern governance. This dApp leverages the immutability of the blockchain to ensure every vote is counted and verifiable.

## Technical Approach
Smart contracts deployed on Sepolia testnet handle the voting logic. The frontend connects via MetaMask to allow users to cast votes, which are emitted as events on-chain.

## Results
- **Security**: 100% tamper-proof voting record.
- **Transparency**: Anyone can audit the contract and vote counts in real-time.
